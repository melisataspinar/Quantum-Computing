The aim of this notebook is to factorize a given integer in polynomial time complexity using quantum computing. I thus implement Shor's algorithm (including both the classical and the quantum parts), and use the integer 15 as my example. 

During my implementation, I make use of important methods such as the Fourier transform in the quantum realm, as well as the Euclidian algorithm.

I use IBM Quantum Lab and Qiskit as I am dealing with quantum computing.
